Maps:

* There are quite a few new caves and buildings, some benign and some designed to be useful. (Won't be discussed as there may be contests to find them and such.)
* Some old locations that were "removed" have also been tweaked or redesigned to fix the problems and re-added. A couple were just deleted, deemed beyond hope of repair.
* A couple big changes to current maps as well.
* Every single map in the game has been gone over with a careful eye multiple times, tweaked and adjusted to be as correct as possible. This includes:
	- Fixing where you can walk. Areas that shouldn't be walkable like under rocks and such have been removed, while areas that should be walkable (you click but you can't go there) are.
	- General design fixes (floating objects, items just poorly placed or stuck in other items they shouldn't be stuck in, etc.)
	- An incredible amount of work has been done to reduce flickering of items seen when the camera is moved. (May never be 100%, but a good chunk of it's fixed.)
	- Enter locations fixed that cause you to walk in odd directions when you click to use them. Exit drop locations fixed where you end up in an odd corner instead of directly at the entrance door/cave/etc.
	- Most all harvestables that are in a harvestable area are now actually reachable, where design allowed. (Some placed as decor-only and are not allowed to be harved on that map remain that way.)
	- Some harvestables stuck inside cave walls and such brought out. (This being a very time-consuming and difficult task, it was not done 100%, but I got to what I could.) This will be why when you visit some harv spots you know, there may be more ores or minerals or such there than were before. Those were always there, just hidden in the walls.
(While most work done of this nature on current maps won't be visibly noticeable, it will be in some areas. Nothing drastic in these cases, so I call them "easter eggs". ;-) )
And of course, all reported bugs fixed.

Some minor points that can be discussed (these only go into effect when 1.9.4 is released, not before):
	- Palon Vertas main map will be multi-combat (currently single)
	- The Whitestone crafting school will work
	- Both Zirakinbar schools (manu school on the east side near docks, craft school area near EP exit) work
	- Trassian Manufacturing school (southwest corner of Trassian) works
	- The entire inside-the-stands area of the KJ temple arena will be PK, not just an unmarked square in the middle of it.
	- Mount Sorrow in SRM is harvestable.
	- The dung portal room has had flags placed above each outhouse indicating where they lead. You can "eye" the flags for specific info, or if you don't know the map flags (shame on you)

Misc:

* Heavily updated (English) Encyclopedia and book/knowledge list
